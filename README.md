# Symmetric bilinear system controllability analysis
This repository contains MATLAB code for controllability analysis presented in the paper "Deformable Object Shape Trajectory Control with Data-Driven Koopman and Bilinear Models" by I. Cuiral-Zueco.

*Robot setup from which data was acquired.*

## Overview
The code provided here implements the MATLAB version of the Mathematica code found in Table 2.2 of *Bilinear Control Systems: Matrices in Action* by D. L. Elliott (Springer, 2009). Specifically, it focuses on providing functionality for controllability analysis for the bilinear model introduced in our paper.

## Case Examples
### First Case Example: Two Working Robots
In this case, both robots are being used with \(2\) translation and \(1\) rotation Degree of Freedom (DoF) each.

### Second Case Example: One Robot "Breaks"
Similar to the first case, but in this scenario, robot \(1\) "breaks," meaning that matrices \(B_1\) to \(B_3\) are eliminated.

## Controllability Analysis
The code includes functionality to analyze the controllability of the system based on specific conditions, as outlined in the literature.

## Usage
To use the code:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure MATLAB is installed (code made using MATLAB R2023b).
3. Download the data matrices 'BmatricesExp3.mat', obtained from our experiments setup.
4. Run the MATLAB script.

## Functions
The repository includes:
- `LieTree`: Computes the basis of the Lie algebra generated by the system's \(B_m\) matrices.
- `liebracket`: Calculates the Lie bracket of two matrices.
- `Dim`: Calculates the dimension of the span of a list of matrices.
